After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.



So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.



Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.


**The Role**



We are a central quality team for Square work across hardware, POS and web surface areas which allows customers (buyers and sellers) to work in our ecosystem of products and services. You will ensure our sellers and their customers have a remarkable experience by shaping our software validation strategy for our Square Products that span across mobile, web and hardware.


**You Will**


* Determine when our product software meets the needs of our sellers by applying your expertise in product architecture.
* Assess product risks throughout each phase of development, deployment, and usage.
* Take ownership of defining and overseeing the execution of a comprehensive validation strategy—both manual and automated—for the platform software integrated into our current and upcoming hardware devices.
* Develop a deep understanding of the integration of applications, systems, and firmware across mobile and web platforms, navigating through different layers of the technology stack.
* Collaborate with multiple development teams and organizations to influence software architecture and design, with a focus on ensuring the validation of all features and functions essential for our sellers' success.
* Utilize your knowledge of product architecture and software component interactions, along with your ability to assess the severity and likelihood of issues, to evaluate product risks during each phase of development, deployment, and usage.
* Advocate for an exceptional customer experience within product engineering by guiding product and process improvements.
* Demonstrate experience resolving technical issues for both engineering and product managers, while advocating for the needs of sellers and customers across mobile and web applications.
* Identify, triage, and follow up on bugs with detailed steps and relevant information, ensuring that critical issues are prioritized to maintain an excellent experience for both sellers and buyers.


**You Have**


* 5\\+ years of verification, validation and/or software engineering experience.
* Developed validation strategy for a complex functional area.
* Identify, classify, prioritize and lead closure of issues in multiple products and software releases.
* Experience working as a partner on a cross\\-functional team.

San Francisco, CA


Being an engineer at a company smaller than 10 people is special. You’ll have a ton of autonomy, be expected to own and build a significant part of the product, and design the product’s growth for the next set of engineers who will be joining us. You’ll wear many hats: developer, designer, product owner, mentor, architect, support engineer, and sales engineer. Our engineers are strongly opinionated people who want to continuously improve the product they’re working on, the team they’re in, the company they’re working at, and the world around them.


Much of our product is still being discovered, but the need is very apparent through tens of conversations with heads of engineering, posts on Twitter and LinkedIn, and the fact that we have a good number of companies who want to sign up as design partners. There’s not much out there about us yet, but we are well funded by investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Boldstart Capital. I’ll share more once we meet.

**Frontend Engineer**
=====================


Our system is a real\\-time stream processing application built on top of Apache Flink, running on Kubernetes in AWS. The user\\-facing application is a Java\\-based web back\\-end interacting with a React/Typescript front\\-end using REST APIs. This application manages all the streaming pipelines on behalf of the user, translating their intents into complex streaming Flink pipelines, and delivering our awesome sauce. It also delivers dashboards and real\\-time operational visibility through configurable charts to our users, and allows them to query the state of their environment in real\\-time. The role would be to own this frontend, deliver an amazing modern user experience to our users from the moment they sign up through the initial steps all the way to getting into production and using our system at scale.


Experience with complex data processing and real\\-time dashboarding applications is important. The ideal candidate cares deeply about the user experience and wants to work closely with the customers, the back\\-end developers and the data engineers to deliver an excellent user experience. They have experience with building large scale data and analytical applications. It would be great if they’ve been at an early stage startup before and understand the type of environment it is and are comfortable with its rapidly evolving nature.

**Engineering Culture**
=======================


I believe very strongly that engineering teams work best when everyone is an equally motivated strong contributor to the team, and when egos are dropped and communication and feedback are open and constant. Our motto is “**team over self**”. We like to look back at our successes and failures and always try to do better. **Our goal is to work smarter, not harder**. We believe being physically together is the best way to build new systems that are rapidly evolving and to mentor and onboard new team members. That’s why **we’re on\\-site at our office at 3043 Mission St, San Francisco, CA at least 4 days a week.**

**Benefits**
============

* Competitive salary and significant equity as one of the first few people on the team.
* Flexible PTO: we really want you to take some time off!
* 100% paid healthcare coverage for employees and 80% coverage for their dependents


Ultimately, a company is the people that form it, and we want to build a place where people will do the best work of their lives. You’ll have a huge impact in helping us figure out all the right pieces to make it an amazing place to work. I hope that makes it as exciting for you as it does for me.


Grepr provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.

Recurrency is a sales, pricing, and purchasing automation platform for distributors. Despite distribution being a multi-trillion dollar industry, the legacy enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that exist to help distributors manage their purchasing, inventory, sales, order processing, and accounting are decades behind. For the most part, ERP systems are painfully slow, difficult-to-use, and soul-crushingly manual.

Recurrency’s goal is to reverse ERP stagnation by building a streamlined and intelligent ERP: blazingly fast and complete with powerful automation tools like dynamic pricing and demand forecasting. Using Recurrency can boost a distributor’s revenue and profit margins, while reducing waste and saving time. Most importantly, Recurrency is fully-integrated with the customer’s legacy system, so deploying Recurrency in production can be done in as little as one day.

Founded in Los Angeles, based in San Francisco and supporting a fully-remote team across the United States, Recurrency is a fast-growing and venture-backed team of talented technologists going all-in on building the next great platform company.
