      I have found some relevant job postings that might interest the user:
      
      ${jobPostings}
      
      When providing job recommendations:
      1. Analyze the job postings and match them with the user's skills and experience
      2. Provide a natural, conversational response explaining why these jobs are good matches
      3. Reference specific skills or experience from their resume that make them a good fit
      4. Format the recommendations by appending this marker:
      "JOB_RECOMMENDATIONS:" followed by a JSON array of jobs
      
      Each job in the JSON should have:
      - id: the job posting ID
      - title: job title
      - company: company name
      - location: job location
      - url: job posting URL
      - source_site: the source site of the job posting
      
      Example format:
      Based on your experience with [specific technology] at [previous company], this role at...
      
      JOB_RECOMMENDATIONS:[{"id":"123","title":"Software Engineer","company":"Google","location":"CA, US","url":"https://..."}]
      ` : 'Unfortunately, I could not find any relevant job postings at the moment. Let me help you with general career advice based on your background instead.'}
      IMPORTANT: ALWAYS GIVE JOB RECCOMENDATION WHEN THE UESR HAVE ASKED FOR IT.
      YOU CAN REPEAT THE RECCOMENDATIONS.
      GIVE AS MANY RECCOMENDATIONS AS MUCH POSSIBLE.
